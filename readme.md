## What does this repo contains so far?

# HMM
## Spoken-Digit-Recognition
### It Is A Isolated Speech Recognition Module using GMM-HMM
- Implementation of a Hidden Markov Model with Gaussian Mixture Model to recognize a spoken digit (GMM-HMM).
This implementation is general and can be used to recognize any isolated speech. Thus it is a Isolated Speech Recogntion module.
## SR-hmmlearn
### Speech Recognition using hmmlearn package
# Language Model 
### Text Generation using Markov Model
- This implementation uses a 2nd order Markov model to train using two files (a set of poems) and produces poems. No.of verses (lines) can be set as a parameter.
